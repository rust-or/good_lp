//!  A Linear Programming modeler that is easy to use, performant with large problems, and well-typed.
//!
//!  ```rust
//!  use good_lp::{variables, variable, default_solver, SolverModel, Solution};
//!
//! // Create variables in a readable format with a macro...
//! variables!{
//!     vars:
//!         a <= 1;
//!         2 <= b <= 4;
//! }
//! // ... or add variables programmatically
//! vars.add(variable().min(2).max(9));
//!
//!  let solution = vars.maximise(10 * (a - b / 5) - b)
//!      .using(default_solver)
//!      .with(a + 2. << b) // or (a + 2).leq(b)
//!      .with(1 + a >> 4. - b)
//!      .solve()?;
//!
//! # use float_eq::assert_float_eq;
//!  assert_float_eq!(solution.value(a), 1., abs <= 1e-8);
//!  assert_float_eq!(solution.value(b), 3., abs <= 1e-8);
//!  # Ok::<_, good_lp::ResolutionError>(())
//!  ```
//!
//! ## Solvers
//!
//! This crate supports multiple solvers,
//! that can be activated using [feature flags](https://docs.rs/crate/good_lp/latest/features).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! You initially create your variables using [variables] and [ProblemVariables::add].
//!
//! Then you create your objective function.If it's large, you can write rust functions
//! to split complex expressions into components.
//!
//! ```
//! use good_lp::{Expression, Variable};
//!
//! fn total_cost(energy: Variable, time: Variable) -> Expression {
//! #   let dollars_per_hour = 0;
//!     energy_cost(energy) + dollars_per_hour * time
//! }
//!
//! fn energy_cost(energy: Variable) -> Expression {
//! #   let fetch_energy_price = |_| 0.;
//!     let price = fetch_energy_price(energy);
//!     energy * price
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then you create a [solver](solvers) problem model instance
//! ```
//! # let my_variables = good_lp::variables!();
//! # let my_objective = good_lp::Expression::from(0);
//! # let my_solver = good_lp::default_solver;
//! let mut model = my_variables.minimise(my_objective).using(my_solver);
//! ```
//!
//! Then you add constraints and solve your problem using the methods in [SolverModel].
//!
