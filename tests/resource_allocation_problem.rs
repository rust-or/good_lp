//! This example shows how to use the "good_lp" library for solving a resource allocation problem
//! using linear programming.
//!
//! In this problem, we decide the production quantities for several products.
//! Each product requires a certain amount of fuel and time to produce,
//! and provides a specific profit per unit.
//!
//! The goal is to maximize the overall profit without exceeding the available fuel and time.
//!
//! Here, both fuel and time are available in limited quantities, and the number of products can vary.
//! Conversely, if you have a fixed set of products and multiple resource types,
//! the modeling becomes even simpler: you can build a SolverModel directly and add constraints dynamically,
//! without needing to store extra expressions in your problem structure.
